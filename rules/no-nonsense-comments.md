Prefer no comment over a low-value one, including template and markup comments. Every comment must
still make sense to someone who checked out this branch with zero knowledge of our session.

Keep comments short: 1 or 2 lines are typically enough, and length itself is an AI tell. When a
comment outgrows that, keep only the invariant the next editor must not break; the rest goes to the
tracker or the PR description.

Don't write:
- **References to tickets** — "PRO-1234", "#7439", etc., except for the hazard warning below.
- **Process / change narration** — "see plan", "as discussed", "now also handles X", "switched from
  Y", "step N", "mirrors/ported from X" (provenance of copied logic), etc
- **Self-reference** — "I added", "Claude generated", "AI-suggested".
- **Restating the code** — `// increment counter` above `counter++`; "X has no option Y, so we
  override it here" above the override.
- **Dead context** — references to removed code or earlier iterations.
- **Future-work pointers & bug write-ups** — follow-up tickets/PBIs, "will be handled in X",
  roadmap notes, descriptions of a known bug or shortcoming: the tracker owns those, not the
  source code. A one-line hazard warning with a ticket reference is fine; the bug's mechanics
  live in the ticket.

Do write, when it adds value: the non-obvious **why** (trade-offs, constraints, workarounds);
invariants and assumptions; easily-missed edge cases; external references explaining the code as
it is (RFCs, spec sections — never the code the logic was ported from); warnings
about non-obvious failure or ordering needs.
"Non-obvious" means beyond a competent dev's common knowledge and not inferable from the code itself
— standard-practice rationale doesn't qualify, nor does a workaround's why unless the code can't
reveal it (an upstream bug, a hidden side effect).

Comments you do write must sound like a colleague typed them, not an AI: actually invoke the
`use-conversational-language` skill and follow its conventions — reciting them from memory does
not count.

Bad: `// Overrides default per plan; previously returned null`

Good: `// Empty result preserves the public API contract for unauthenticated users`

Test before writing any comment: would a colleague who wrote this change themselves, with zero
knowledge of our session, have written this comment? If a human author would not have, do not
write it.
