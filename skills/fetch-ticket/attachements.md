# Attachments & design references

## Attachments

Identify every attachment **and** every inline image referenced in the description/fields, numbered
`attachment-<N>.<ext>` in order of first appearance, keeping the original extension. `<N>` runs
across both combined. In a directory shared with other tickets, prefix each ticket's files with its
id (`<id>-attachment-<N>.<ext>`, linked-doc saves included) so siblings never overwrite each other.

**Always try to fetch — across every connected MCP.** Beyond tracker-hosted attachments, the ticket
may link external assets (e.g. a wiki or linked-doc resource — for design-tool links such as Figma or
Zeplin see Design references below) reachable through their own MCP, including spec/doc files in a
linked git repo (fetch their content via git or the repo MCP, save into the output dir under their
own filename). Use whichever MCP fits the source to pull them down; don't pre-declare a link
unfetchable. If a fitting MCP is connected but **not authenticated**, don't silently skip —
proactively run its auth flow (surface the login URL, complete the handshake) without waiting to
be asked, then fetch. When it's unclear whether an asset can or should be downloaded, ask the user.

Download each **straight to disk** — `curl -fSL <url> -o attachment-<N>.<ext>`, or the MCP
attachment tool's save-to-path variant. **Never** route an attachment as inline base64 through the
model and re-emit it: output caps (~100k chars) truncate it silently — valid header, missing
trailer, won't open. Some attachment MCP tools return **only** base64 with no save-to-path option
— don't use them for binaries; fetch from the tracker's REST API or a signed content URL straight
to disk instead. Content URLs often share the MCP's auth; on 401, retry with the tracker's bearer
token if obtainable.

**Verify integrity, not just transfer** — non-empty; matches `Content-Length` if sent; type trailer
present (PNG `IEND`, JPEG `FFD9`, PDF `%%EOF`). A size that's an exact multiple of 3 near a round
character boundary signals base64 truncation. On failure, re-download to disk; if still bad, treat
as **not downloaded** and warn — never reference a corrupt file. Then, per file:

- **Downloaded** → reference the local file.
- **Not downloaded** (no fitting MCP/attachment tool, auth that couldn't be completed, etc.) →
  still reference the local file and the source URL, and add it to the list to warn about. Don't
  block — the ticket is usable either way.

Image → embed; non-image (PDF, .docx, …) → link instead:

```markdown
### Attachment 1

![attachment-1](attachment-1.png)
_Original filename: image.png_

### Attachment 2

[attachment-2.pdf](attachment-2.pdf) — _Original filename: design-spec.pdf_
```

For a file that couldn't be downloaded, append its source so the user can fetch it manually: `— not
downloaded; get it from <url> and save here as attachment-<N>.<ext>`.

## Design references

For design-tool links (Figma, Zeplin, Sketch, Adobe XD, …) in the description/comments, don't number
them as `attachment-<N>` — they're living references, not attached files. Capture each referenced
frame/screen via that tool's MCP (e.g. Figma MCP `get_screenshot`), downloading the returned
short-lived URL straight to disk as `<tool>-<id>-<slug>.png` (auth its MCP first if needed — see
Attachments). If no MCP for that tool is connected, still record the entry with its name and source
URL and add it to the warn list — same as an undownloaded attachment. Record one entry per link,
with the local preview plus the identifiers needed to re-open it in that tool:

```markdown
### <design name>

![figma-<nodeId>](figma-<nodeId>-<slug>.png)
_Figma · file `<fileKey>` · node `<nodeId>` · [source](<url>)_
```
