# Challenger prompt

Template for the challenge step in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md): one challenger per surviving candidate,
fresh context each. Fill every `<placeholder>`; include the session's positive leads only — never
its negative findings ("checked X, nothing there"), which would anchor the fresh context onto the
author's search path.

---

You are challenging a question about to be raised with a ticket's requirements owner. The
reviewing session believes no available source answers it. Assume the opposite: **the answer
exists — hunt it down.** Your job is to kill the question, not to confirm it.

**Question (verbatim):**
<question>

**Feature context:** <2–3 sentences: the feature, the tickets in play — no session reasoning>

**Where to look:**
- Ticket files: <ticket-set directory>
- Repos: <every repo root the feature spans — for a backend/frontend pair, both>

**Leads worth checking first:** <positive leads, or "none">
A lead is a starting point, never a license to skip a source class below.

**Exhaust every source class**, probing each for the answer:

1. **Code** — every repo listed, whole-repo hunts: search each repo for the concept itself, never
   only the spot the ticket names.
2. **Tracker** — keyword-search for the concept across tickets, never only the input tickets'
   linked relatives; deep-dive telling hits, comment threads included — decisions hide there.
3. **Designs** — through the design tool's own MCP/API when available, other frames and variants
   included; exported screenshots are not the design.
4. **Docs on disk** — spec/plan files in the ticket directory and the repos.
5. **Branches** — branches, commits, PRs the tickets link.

6. **Derive** — after the hunts, two inference moves. Structural: do the governing docs settle
   it without an explicit statement — a scope rule assigns authority elsewhere (e.g. "design
   leading for styling only" puts an undesigned behavior out of scope), an exhaustive
   requirements or success-criteria list is silent on the element, a confirmed deviation removes
   the element's premise? Elimination: when the question weighs options, test each against the
   requirements and the evidence gathered — an option the requirements cannot accept is off the
   table; a sole survivor is the answer, even when enacting it is another repo's or team's work.
   A derive kill cites every quote the inference rests on.

You are strictly read-only: modify no file, ticket, or external system.

**Return:**
- **Verdict** — `KILLED` (found the answer), `RESHAPED` (found part of it), or `OPEN` (found
  nothing).
- **Answer** (KILLED/RESHAPED) — the answer, with a citation precise enough to verify blind: file
  path + lines + verbatim quote, ticket id + quoted text, or design frame id. RESHAPED adds what
  remains open.
- **Evidence trail** (always, every verdict) — per source class: what you probed (searches run,
  files, tickets, frames opened) and what it said. A source you could not reach (rate-limited,
  missing) is recorded as unavailable, never skipped silently.
